    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>Popular both in Rajasthan and other parts of North India, the Moong Dal Halwa is a rich and decadent Indian
        dessert made with moong lentils,
        ghee, milk, sugar, fragrant flavorings and nuts. The richness of this Moong Dal Halwa recipe makes
        it a perfect dish to keep the body warm during the extreme winters of Northern India. It is a bit
        heavy, but you really can’t miss trying on this special halwa preparation. I’ll also suggest that you
        run an extra mile after having it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup yellow moong dal (split yellow gram)</li>
        <li>saffron (kesar) strands</li>
        <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ghee</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cardamom powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp almonds silvers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak 1 cup moong dal (spilt and husked yellow moong lentils) in enough water overnight or for 4 to 5 hours.
            I soaked the lentils overnight. </li>
        <li>Drain and grind the moong dal to a smooth paste with very little water. Make a thick batter like consistency
            and do not make it runny or watery.</li>
        <li>Melt 9 to 10 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) in a well-seasoned wok or kadai or a non-stick kadai or
            frying pan.</li>
        <li>Add the ground moong dal paste.</li>
        <li>Stir to mix well. When stirring and mixing the mixture in the kadai, it started sticking so much to the iron
            kadai. So, I shifted the mixture to a non-stick kadai. It was very easy to stir the halwa then.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring the moong dal mixture on medium-low to medium heat. The raw aroma of the moong lentils should
            go away completely before you go on to the next step. So, till then you have to stir and cook it.</li>
        <li>While the mixture is cooking, in another pan or kadai, take 1 cup full fat whole milk, 2 cups water and 1 or
            1.25 cups sugar. Keep this pan on the stovetop and stir so that the sugar dissolves. Heat this mixture till
            it comes to a boil.</li>
        <li>The moong dal mixture should separate and look golden as shown in the picture below. It will have a granular
            consistency. The aroma and color will change. The fat will separate.</li>
        <li>This is the boiling milk mixture. This is added to the well roasted moong lentils mixture. </li>
        <li>Pour the boiling milk mixture to the roasted moong lentils. The mixture bubbles and sizzles, so be careful
            while adding the hot milk mixture.</li>
        <li>The liquid should get absorbed and once again you will see the ghee getting separated. This means the halwa
            is finally done.

            Add ¼ to ⅓ teaspoon green cardamom powder, 10 to 12 chopped unsalted pistachios and 1 tablespoon golden
            raisins and mix before serving. It took me a total of about 1 hour to make this halwa on the stovetop.

            You can add your choice of nuts or dry fruits. Some options are cashews, almonds or pine nuts.</li>
